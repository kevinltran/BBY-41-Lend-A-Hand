          <h1>Term 2 CST Student</h1>Hi, I'm glad you found our app and I hope it makes your life a little easier. I'm
          currently finishing my second term of the Computer Systems Technology course at BCIT. I come from a
          background of automotive refinishing, where I hold
          a red seal journeyman ticket but I switched to computers recently to expand my knowledge. So far it has been
          very interesting and I can't
          wait to finish my degree and see where life takes me from there. </p>

          <h1>Term 2 CST Student</h1>
          <p>Hi there! My name is Leon and I've just finished my second term at BCIT's CST program. Before diving into
            computer science, I achieved a BSc in Biochemistry and
            Molecular Biology at UBC. After that, I worked for 2 years at a laboratory known as ALS Environmental.
            During my spare time there, I started teaching myself a bit of code
            through online bootcamps and discovered a new passion for programming! Long story short, I'm currently
            having lots of fun building apps and can't wait to begin working in this field!

            Hi guys! My names Kevin Tran and I am currently a first term CST student. Before coming to to BCIT I
            studied
            at UBC for 2 years learning all things Computer Science. Working on this
            app has been a super fun experience so far, the daily SCRUMS really keep us honest about our work. I hope
            you find our app useful and inspiring!

          <h1>Term 1 CST Student</h1>
          <p>Hello guys! My name is Oves and I am a first term CST student at BCIT. Before BCIT I did General Studies
            at Kwantlen Polytechnic University. I like to play video games, watch movies and read books in my free
            time.
            Working on this app has helped me hone what I learned in my first term. I hope this app is able to help
            those in need.
