              pandemic. Working together has greatly increased our team work and collaboration skills as we need to
              adapt to each others' tendencies and schedules. Our team is hard-working and effiecient and we synergise
              well
              with each other. We covered each others weaknesses and provided effective assistance when needed. We hope
              our teamwork resonates throughout our app and that it is able to provide the help that you need.

            <h1>Term 2 CST Student</h1>Hi, I'm glad you found our app and I hope it makes your life a little easier. I'm
            currently finishing my second term of the Computer Systems Technology course at BCIT. I come from a
            background of automotive refinishing, where I hold
            a red seal journeyman ticket but I switched to computers recently to expand my knowledge. So far it has been
            very interesting and I can't
            wait to finish my degree and see where life takes me from there. </p>

            <h1>Term 2 CST Student</h1>
            <p>Hi there! My name is Leon and I've just finished my second term at BCIT's CST program. Before diving into
              computer science, I achieved a BSc in Biochemistry and
              Molecular Biology at UBC. After that, I worked for 2 years at a laboratory known as ALS Environmental.
              During my spare time there, I started teaching myself a bit of code
              through online bootcamps and discovered a new passion for programming! Long story short, I'm currently
              having lots of fun building apps and can't wait to begin working in this field!

              Hi guys! My names Kevin Tran and I am currently a first term CST student. Before coming to to BCIT I
              studied
              at UBC for 2 years learning all things Computer Science. Working on this
              app has been a super fun experience so far, the daily SCRUMS really keep us honest about our work. I hope
              you find our app useful and inspiring!

            <p>Hello guys! My name is Oves and I am a first term CST student at BCIT. Before BCIT I did General Studies
              at Kwantlen Polytechnic University. I like to play video games, watch movies and read books in my free
              time.
              Working on this app has helped me hone what I learned in my first term. I hope this app is able to help
              those in need.
